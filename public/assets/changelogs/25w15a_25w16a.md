# Additions
- Added a `happy_ghast_ropes.png` texture

# Changes
- Block models can now be rotated by any angle instead of being limited to multiples of 22.5
- The cloud texture `clouds.png` can no longer be colored

# Shader Changes
- The main menu panorama now uses the `core/panorama` fragment and `core/position_color` vertex programs.
- All shader uniforms are now grouped in uniform blocks. Although not listed on the bug tracker, this change fixes [MC-296043](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC/issues/MC-296043) which means it is safe to use uniforms that the default shaders don't normally use. For core shaders, definitions for these exist within the following include shaders:
   - `#moj_import <minecraft:dynamictransforms.glsl>` for `ModelViewMat`, `ColorModulator`, `ModelOffset`, `TextureMat`, and `LineWidth` uniforms
   - `#moj_import <minecraft:projection.glsl>` for `ProjMat` uniform
   - `#moj_import <minecraft:globals.glsl>` for `ScreenSize`, `GlintAlpha`, `GameTime`, and `MenuBlurRadius` uniforms
   - `#moj_import <minecraft:light.glsl>` for `Light0_Direction` and `Light1_Direction` uniforms
   - `#moj_import <minecraft:fog.glsl>` for `FogColor`, `FogShape`, `FogStart`, `FogEnd`, `FogSkyEnd`, and `FogCloudsEnd` uniforms
- `targets` in post-effects now support two new optional fields: `persistent` and `clear_color`.
- The `uniforms` field in post-effects is now a list of uniform blocks, example: `{ "UniformBlockName": [ { "type": "vec2", "value": [...] } ] }`.
- In post-effects, the list of size uniforms (all `vec2 *Size`) have been replaced with a single `SamplerInfo` uniform block.
