# Additions
Added new blockstates, models, textures, and sounds for:
- Copper Chests
- Copper Golems and their statue variants
- Copper Tools and Armor
- Shelves
- Oxidised Lightning Rod variants

# Changes
The dye textures have been redesigned. Will not affect custom dye textures

# pack.mcmeta Changes
Pack metadata files have changed
- Pack formats now have `minor` and `major` versions
  - The major version is only incremented if breaking changes are made. For example texture UVs changing, files being moved, etc
  - The minor version is incremented for small changes. For example, new assets being added
- Two new fields were added for the `pack` and `overlays` objects: `min_format` and `max_format`
  - These can either be a major format number `65`, or both the major and minor number `[65, 3]`
  - Specifying only the major version means your pack will support all of that major version. Specifying the minor version limits it to support just that minor version

### Old pack.mcmeta
This pack supports pack format 16 to 55, and has an overlay applied when the pack format is in the range 16 to 34
```json
{
  "pack": {
    "description": "My Resource Pack",
    "pack_format": 55,
    "supported_formats": {
      "min_inclusive": 16,
      "max_inclusive": 55
    }
  },
  "overlays": {
    "entries": [
      {
        "directory": "16-34",
        "formats": {
          "min_inclusive": 16,
          "max_inclusive": 34
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### New pack.mcmeta
This pack supports pack format 65 to 69.3
The first overlay is applied for all major and minor pack formats from 65 to 67
The second overlay is applied for all major and minor pack formats from 66.2 to 69.3. Formats 66.0, 66.1, and 69.4 are all ignored since they are outside this range.
```json
{
  "pack": {
    "description": "My Resource Pack",
    "min_format": 65,
    "max_format": [69, 3]
  },
  "overlays": {
    "entries": [
      {
        "directory": "ranged_overlay",
        "min_format": 65,
        "max_format": 67
      },
      {
        "directory": "specific_overlay",
        "min_format": [66, 2],
        "max_format": [69, 3]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Combined pack.mcmeta
This pack.mcmeta supports both the new format and old format at the same time, and can be used in both new and old versions
```json
{
  "pack": {
    "description": "My Resource Pack",
    "pack_format": 69, // Ignored in 1.21.9, for old versions
    "supported_formats": [16, 69], // For old versions
    "min_format": 16, // For 1.21.9+
    "max_format": 69, // For 1.21.9+
  },
  "overlays": {
    "entries": [
      { // Even though this overlay is for older game versions, it still needs the new formatting
        "directory": "old_overlay",
        "formats": { // For old versions
          "min_inclusive": 16,
          "max_inclusive": 34
        },
        "min_format": 16, // For 1.21.9+
        "max_format": 34 // For 1.21.9+
      },
      { // Even though this overlay is for newer game versions, when old overlays are present, all overlays must provide the old formatting
        "directory": "new_overlay",
        "formats": { // For old versions
          "min_inclusive": 65,
          "max_inclusive": 69
        },
        "min_format": 65, // For 1.21.9+
        "max_format": 69 // For 1.21.9+
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Important notes
- The `min_format` (major version) and minimum value in `supported_formats` and `formats` MUST match
- If the `min_format` is `65` or higher, `supported_formats` must be entirely removed
   - This also applies to `formats` in overlays if the `min_format` is `65` or higher in _all_ overlays
- Pack format 15 and lower are not supported at all

# Shader Changes
- The `core/blit_screen.vsh`, `post/blit.vsh`, `post/blur.vsh`, `post/invert.vsh`, `post/sobel.vsh`, and `post/screenquad.vsh` shader programs have been removed and replaced by `core/screenquad.vsh`.
   - For post, these can still be changed in the post_effect definition if you need to modify the vertex shader
 - Vertex shaders for post-processing effects and full screen blits are no longer are passed a `Position` attribute. These must assign vertex coordinates using `gl_VertexID` instead.
   Additionally, these shaders are only executed with 3 vertices instead of a full quad like they were previously.
