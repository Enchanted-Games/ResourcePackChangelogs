# Items

New `minecraft:component` select property has been added

This basically allows you to change the item model/texture based on the item's component values. Name based models and textures are now possible!

*(components that use registries are not working)*

# Entity Equipment
All Saddles have been removed from their respective textures, and moved into the `entity/equipment/` folder

# Other
New test blocks textures and models were added. 

Entity subpredicates have been removed in favour of entity variant components, this allows items to be changed based on entity data present inside
