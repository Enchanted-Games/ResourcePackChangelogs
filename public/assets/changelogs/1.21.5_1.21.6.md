# Additions
- Added new happy ghast assets
- Added locator bar textures
- Added `warning_button.png`, `warning_button_disabled.png`, and `warning_button_highlighted.png` textures for the new dialog system.
- Added `music_notes.png` and `now_playing.png` textures for the "now playing" toast
- Added `tears.png` music disc textures and models
- Added sounds for the leash snapping: `entity/leashknot/break`


# Changes
## Textures
- Blaze and breeze spawn eggs have been resized
- Small fix to the pale oak boat textures
- The regular ghast textures have been upscaled, from 64x32 to 128x64
- The popup GUI background texture has had its colour adjusted
- The clouds texture has been redesigned. This change does not affect custom cloud textures.

## Misc
- Block models can now be rotated by any angle instead of being limited to multiples of 22.5
- The cloud texture clouds.png can now only be white, and no longer supports translucency
- In the UNIHEX font provider, the size_overrides field is now optional and defaults to an empty array
- The panorama textures must now all be the same size, and square
- The mob effect sprites now support GUI scaling and nineslicing properties
- Added and removed some splash texts from `splashes.txt`
- Added a new field `oversized_in_gui`. If true, the item model can be bigger than the size of a slot, otherwise it is clipped to the slot size.
- Added a new special model type `minecraft:player_head` which renders a player head model using a texture from the `minecraft:profile` component.
- The `minecraft:head` special model type no longer uses a texture from the `minecraft:profile `component.
- Renamed `entity/leashknot/break1-3` to `entity/leashknot/unleash1-3` and `entity/leashknot/place1-3` to `entity/leashknot/leash1-3`

# Removals
- The mob_effects.json atlas has been removed


# Shader Changes
## Programs
- The main menu panorama now uses the `core/panorama` fragment and vertex programs rather than `core/position_tex`
   - The panorama images are now passed as a `samplerCube` uniform rather than an individual `sampler2d` uniform for each face
- The `core/position_tex` fragment and vertex programs are now unused
- Added two new core shaders: `stars`, and `sky` which are used to render the stars and upper portion of the sky respectively
- The `core/rendertype_crumbling` and `core/rendertype_translucent_moving_block` shaders now support fog
- The `core/rendertype_clouds` has had significant changes. Any old cloud shaders will need almost entirely rewriting
   - Clouds now use vertex pulling; in simple terms this means each vertex has no data assigned to it, the shader is in charge of applying the correct data to verticies based on external data passed as uniforms
   - This shader now recieves an `isamplerBuffer CloudFaces` uniform
   - Verticies no longer have any attributes
   - Added a new uniform block `CloudInfo`, which contains 3 new uniforms `CloudColor`, `CloudOffset`, and `CellSize`
   - This shader no longer has access to the clouds texture
- The `core/lightmap.fsh` shader now recieves a uniform block `LightmapInfo` with the following uniforms defined in order: `AmbientLightFactor`, `SkyFactor`, `BlockFactor`, `UseBrightLightmap`, `NightVisionFactor`, `DarknessScale`, `DarkenWorldFactor`, `BrightnessFactor`, `SkyLightColor`

## Uniforms
- All shader uniforms are now grouped in uniform blocks. This change fixes [MC-296043](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC/issues/MC-296043) which means it is safe to use some uniforms that the default shaders don't normally use (for now, this includes the `Fog` and `Globals` uniform blocks)
- For core shaders, definitions for uniform blocks now exist within the following include shaders:
   - `#moj_import <minecraft:dynamictransforms.glsl>` for the `DynamicTransforms` block. Contains the `ModelViewMat`, `ColorModulator`, `ModelOffset`, `TextureMat`, and `LineWidth` uniforms
   - `#moj_import <minecraft:projection.glsl>` for the `Projection` block. Contains the `Projmat` uniform
   - `#moj_import <minecraft:globals.glsl>` for the `Globals` block. Contains the `ScreenSize`, `GlintAlpha`, `GameTime`, and `MenuBlurRadius` uniforms
   - `#moj_import <minecraft:light.glsl>` for the `Lighting` block. Contains the `Light0_Direction` and `Light1_Direction` uniforms
   - `#moj_import <minecraft:fog.glsl>` for `Fog` block. Containts the `FogColor`, `FogEnvironmentalStart`, `FogEnvironmentalEnd`, `FogRenderDistanceStart`, `FogRenderDistanceEnd`, `FogSkyEnd`, and `FogCloudsEnd` uniforms
- The `FogShape`, `FogStart` and `FogEnd` uniforms have been removed and replaced by `FogEnvironmentalStart/End` and `FogRenderDistanceStart/End`

## Include shaders
- Added new include shaders `globals.glsl`, and `dynamictransforms.glsl` which contain definitions for the `Globals` and `DynamicTransforms` uniform blocks respectively
- The `minecraft_sample_lightmap` has been removed from the `light.glsl` include shader. All shaders that previously used this function now instead sample the lightmap texture directly
- All functions inside `fog.glsl` have been changed, any shaders that use fog will need updating
   - `fog_distance(vec3 pos, int shape)` has been replaced by `fog_spherical_distance(vec3 pos)` and `fog_cylindrical_distance(vec3 pos)`
   - `linear_fog_fade` has been renamed to `linear_fog_value`
   - `linear_fog(vec4 inColor, float vertexDistance, float fogStart, float fogEnd, vec4 fogColor)` has been removed and replaced with `apply_fog(vec4 inColor, float sphericalVertexDistance, float cylindricalVertexDistance, float environmentalStart, float environmantalEnd, float renderDistanceStart, float renderDistanceEnd, vec4 fogColor)`

## Post effect definitions
- Render targets (objects inside the `targets` field) now support two new optional fields: `persistent` and `clear_color`
   - `persistent`: Whether or not this target is cleared between frames
   - `clear_color`: Integer ARGB value or list of floats `[R, G, B, A]`. The 'default' colour for this target before it is written to
- The `uniforms` field is now a list of uniform blocks
   - For example, `uniforms: { "UniformBlockName": [ { "type": "vec2", "value": [...] } ] }` instead of `uniforms: { "UniformName": { "type": "vec2", "values": [...] } } }` 
   - The list of uniforms in a block **must** be the same in the shader and post effect definition file
- Individual uniform definitions have changed
   - The `name` field is no longer used
   - The `values` field has been replace with `value`

## Post effect programs
- The input / output texture size uniforms (all `vec2 *Size`) have been replaced by a single `SamplerInfo` uniform block.
   - This contains the size of every input texture, followed by the size of every output texture in order
   - The order of textures specified on a given pass in the definition file will dictate the order of sizes in this uniform block
   - For example, the individual uniforms `vec2 InSize` and `vec2 OutSize` would now be specified in the `SamplerInfo` block rather in order.
