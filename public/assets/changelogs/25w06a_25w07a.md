# Mooshroom
- The mooshroom textures have been remade

# Item rendering
- Item Display
  - `firstperson_lefthand` and `thirdperson_lefthand` transforms are now rendered the same as when held in hand
    - If the `firstperson_lefthand` or `thirdperson_lefthand` transforms aren't set for an item model, the X translation is now mirrored from the `firstperson_righthand` or `thirdperson_righthand` respectively when the item is displayed using an item display. Previously this would only be the case when an item is being held in a players left hand
- Item Entity
  - Items on the ground should no longer clip into the ground if they are larger than normal
  - Most models can now render automatically as a stack of items on the ground, rather than only `builtin/generated` models

# Shaders
Some breaking changes changes to shaders. Unsure of the full impact. Please read the official changelog for full details.
- Shader program configuration (.json) files have been removed. The shader programs are still present, however they only have the uniforms that are used in vanilla rendering available to them.
- The `EndPortalLayers` uniform has been removed and replaced by a define directive called `PORTAL_LAYERS`
- In post-processing effects, the `program` field has been replaced with `vertex_shader` and `fragment_shader` which point to a shader in `assets/<namespace>/shaders/<path>.vsh|fsh`
- In post-processing effects, `type` is now a required field for each uniform, with the possible values being `int`, `ivec3`, `float`, `vec2`, `vec3`, `vec4` and `matrix4x4`
- In post-processing effects, the `values` field is now optional for each uniform. Leaving it unset is not recommended as it will result in undefined behaviour
