# Mooshroom
- The mooshroom textures have been remade

# Item rendering
- Item Display
  - `firstperson_lefthand` and `thirdperson_lefthand` transforms are now rendered the same as when held in hand
    - If the `firstperson_lefthand` or `thirdperson_lefthand` transforms aren't set for an item model, the X translation is now mirrored from the `firstperson_righthand` or `thirdperson_righthand` respectively when the item is displayed using an item display. Previously this would only be the case when an item is being held in a players left hand
- Item Entity
  - Items on the ground should no longer clip into the ground if they are larger than normal
  - Most models can now render automatically as a stack of items on the ground, rather than only `builtin/generated` models

# Shaders
Some breaking changes changes to shaders. Unsure of the full impact. Please read the official changelog for full details.
