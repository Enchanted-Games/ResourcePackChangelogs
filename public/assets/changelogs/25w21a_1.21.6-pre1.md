# Item model definitions
- Added a new field `oversized_in_gui`. If true, the item model can be bigger than the size of a slot, otherwise it is clipped to the slot size.
- Added a new special model type `minecraft:player_head` which renders a player head model using a texture from the `minecraft:profile` component.
- The `minecraft:head` special model type no longer uses a texture from the `minecraft:profile` component.

# Shader changes
- Some more minor changes to the vertices in `rendertype_clouds.vsh`.
