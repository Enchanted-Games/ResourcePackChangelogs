# Changes
## Creaking Heart
- The `active` state of the creaking heart has been renamed to `awake`, for example: `creaking_heart_awake.png`
- The creaking heart now has a new `dormant` blockstate and textures
## Equipment
- The horse, zombie horse, mule, donkey and camel saddle textures are now separated from the animal texture and moved into `textures/entity/equipment/`
- The elytra, pig saddle and strider saddle textures have been moved into `textures/entity/equipment/`
## Mobs
- The base textures for the cow, pig, and chicken have been renamed to be `temperate_`, for example: `temperate_cow.png`
- The cow, pig, and mooshroom textures have been resized from `64x32` to `64x64`
- Chicken textures have been moved into the `textures/entity/chicken` subfolder
- Cows and mooshrooms now have modeled snouts
- The `sheep_fur.png` texture has been renamed to `sheep_wool.png`
- The sheep wool on a sheared sheep can now be tinted using the `sheep_wool_undercoat.png` texture
## Misc
- A new `minecraft:component` select property has been added to item definitions, allowing items to have component-based models. For example, an item's texture can now dynamically change based on its name
- Spawn eggs now have unique textures, for example: `allay_spawn_egg.png`
- The `misc/enchanted_glint_entity.png` texture has been renamed to `misc/enchanted_glint_armor.png`

# Shader Changes
- Added a new shader, `rendertype_world_border`, which is used to render the world border
- The `EndPortalLayers` uniform has been removed and replaced by a define directive called `PORTAL_LAYERS`
- Shader program configuration files have been removed. The shader programs are still present and have most uniforms available to them by default
   - Due to [a bug](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC/issues/MC-296043), using uniforms that the default shaders dont normally use is unreliable and may not work on all devices
- In post-processing effects, the `program` field has been replaced with `vertex_shader` and `fragment_shader` which point to a shader in `assets/<namespace>/shaders/<path>.vsh|fsh`
- In post-processing effects, `type` is now a required field for each uniform, with the possible values being `int`, `ivec3`, `float`, `vec2`, `vec3`, `vec4` and `matrix4`
- In post-processing effects, the `values` field is now optional for each uniform. Leaving it unset is not recommended as it will result in undefined behaviour
