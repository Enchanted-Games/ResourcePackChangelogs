# Cows
- The snout texture change from last snapshot was reverted, but the model change was kept
- The horns on the temperate cow have been moved forwards one pixel
- The top texture of the cow leg has been tweaked

# Sheep
- The sheep wool texture has been tweaked

# Test blocks
- Test blocks have been completely redesigned

# Enchanting Glint
- The `misc/enchanted_glint_entity.png` texture has been renamed to `misc/enchanted_glint_armor.png`

# Shaders
- Shader programs can now use all "global" uniforms.
   - Currently, the "global" uniforms are: `ModelViewMat`, `ProjMat`, `TextureMat`, `ScreenSize`, `ColorModulator`, `Light0_Direction`, `Light1_Direction`, `GlintAlpha`, `FogStart`, `FogEnd`, `FogColor`, `FogShape`, `LineWidth`, `GameTime`, and `ModelOffset`
   - Due to [a bug](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC/issues/MC-296043), using uniforms that the default shaders don't normally use is unreliable and may not work on all devices
